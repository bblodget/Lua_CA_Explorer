## Quick Start

Use the TAB key to toggle between "console" mode and "normal" mode.

Here is an example you can type in to the console to initialize
the field with a random pattern.  Then initialize the table with
the Conway's Game of Life rules. Set the frame rate, then start it running.

```lua
make_table(life, PLN0)
make_table(echo, PLN1)
rand_plane(20)
set_fps(20)
run()
```
