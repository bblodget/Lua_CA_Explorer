# What are Cellular Automata?

Cellular Automata are interesting because they demonstrate
that complex, unpredictable behavior can arise from
very simple rules, and only local communication.

Think of Cellular Automata as a grid (or field)
of cells.  Where a cell is like a very simple processor.
All the cells/processors are running the same simple function.
This function generates the cell's next state.  There
are a discrete number of states.  Often there are only two
states such as, "on" or "off" ("alive" or "dead").
The function, as input, gets the current states of all the cells
in its neighborhood. So the next state of a cell is a function
of its current state, and the state of its neighbors.
All the cells in the grid are updated synchronously.
It is as if there is a global clock and at each tick of the clock,
every cell generates a new output.  Each
tick of the clock, creates a new "generation" of cells.
We often say things like "after 567 generations it reaches steady state".

# Cellular Automata Resources

Cellular Automata were originally discovered in the 1940s, and have-
had a long and colorful history since then. Here are some resources.
