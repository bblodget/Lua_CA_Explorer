# Welcome

If you want to go directly to the

Also this link is in the upper right corner of the header bar.

These pages provide some documentation for the LUA CA Explorer.
This work was inspired the book
[Cellular Automata Machines, A New Environment for Modeling](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/HBlJzrBKUTEC?hl=en&gbpv=0) by Tommaso Toffoli Norman Margolus published in 1987.

This book described a custom piece of hardware, called CAM6, that could be plugged into
a PC to accelerate running Cellular Automata experiments.  The PC of the late 1980s were-
too slow to run CA's in reasonable time.  The CAM6 provided a "laboratory" to explore the worlds
that could be created by Cellular Automata.

The book explored many interesting Cellular Automata.
The CAM6 was programmed using the language Forth.
Originally I planned to use Forth, so you could type
in the examples directly from the book.  However the CAM Forth
used in the book was a little non-standard, supporting the syntax
was taking more time than I wanted.  I decided to switch to
Lua as the scripting language.  This means that you can't just
type in the examples from the book.  However I think the-
translation to Lua is pretty straightforward.
