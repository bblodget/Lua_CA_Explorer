# Welcome

If you want to go directly to the
[LUA CA Explorer WebApp click here](/WASM/basic_template.html).
Also this link is in the upper right corner of the header bar.

These pages provides some documentation for the LUA CA Explorer.
This work was inspired the book
[Celluar Automata Machines, A New Environment for Modeling](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/HBlJzrBKUTEC?hl=en&gbpv=0) by Tommaso Toffoli Norman Margolus published in 1987.

This book described a custom piece of hardware, called CAM6, that could be plugged into
a PC to accelerate running Celluar Automata experiments.  The PC of the late 1980s were 
too slow to run CA's in reasonable time.  The CAM6 provided a "laboratory" to explore the worlds
that could be created by Celluar Automata.

The book explored many interesting Celluar Automata.
The CAM6 was programmed using the language Forth.
Originally I planned to use Forth, so you could type
in the examples directly from the book.  However the CAM Forth
used in the book was a little non-standard, supporting the syntax
was taking more time than I wanted.  I decided to swith to
Lua as the scripting language.  This means that you can't just
type in the examples from the book.  However I think the 
translation to Lua is pretty straighforward.
